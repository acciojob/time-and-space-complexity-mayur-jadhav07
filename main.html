	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Achieving an efficient solution often entails 
		considering the time complexity of the algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>Considering a space complexity of O(n) ensures that the 
		algorithm utilizes memory efficiently, scaling linearly 
		with the input size. 
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space 
		required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function 
		of the input size.
